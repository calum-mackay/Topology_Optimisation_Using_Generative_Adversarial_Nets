# Topology_Optimisation_Using_Generative_Adversarial_Nets

This study explores the novel application of a leading machine learning architecture known as Generative Adversarial Neural Networks (GANs) for the application of topology optimisation. These algorithms negate the need for explicit calculation of the physical fields and are therefore believed to provide an alternative to iterative mechanistic methods such as the density based SIMP approach [1]. However, machine learning models in engineering are often limited due to the computational expense involved in collecting training data. In addition, such data driven approaches lack the physical consistency to generalise beyond the training data set. Physics Informed machine learning techniques promise to combat these limitations through the incorporation of domain knowledge into the network architecture. In this study, novel physics Informed methods have been explored for the application of generative topology optimisation on a 2D beam.
